This is a command line utility to download and install Xcode in headless mode (from a Terminal only).

## TL;DR

![Download](img/download.png)
![Install](img/install.png)

## What is it

`xcodeinstall` is a command line utility to download and install Xcode from the terminal only. It may work interactively or unattended. In **interactive mode**, it prompts you for your Apple Developer account username, password and MFA code.  In **unattended mode**, it fetches your Apple Developer username and password from AWS Secrets Manager. (Instructions to configure this are below).

When **MFA is configured** (which we highly recommend), a human interaction is required to enter the MFA code sent to your device.  This step cannot be automated.

The Apple Developer Portal username and password ARE NOT STORED on the local volume. They are used to interact with Apple's Developer Portal API and collect a session token.  The session token is stored in `$HOME/.xcodeinstall` or on AWS Secrets Manager.

When using AWS Secrets Manager, Apple session token and cookies are securely stored on AWS Secrets Manager. The session token and cookies may be shared from multiple cloud machines. For example: you may authenticate interactively, using MFA, from your laptop, and have the command running unattended, from a script running on your cloud machine.

The session stays valid for several days, sometimes weeks before it expires.  When the session expires, you have to authenticate again. Apple might prompts you for a new authentication when connecting from a new IP address or location (switching between laptop and EC2 instance for example)

> When using Secrets Manager for authentication, it is required to use it FROM THE SAME AWS REGION, for the `list` and `download` command.

## Demo

## Why install Xcode in headless mode?

When preparing a macOS machine in the cloud for CI/CD, you don't always have access to the login screen, or you don't want to access it.

It is a best practice to automate the preparation of your build environment to ensure they are always identical.

## How to install 

Most of you are not interest by the source code. To install the brinary, use [homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager and install a custom tap, then install the package. 

First, install the custom tap. This is a one-time operation.

```zsh
‚ûú  ~ brew tap sebsto/macos

==> Tapping sebsto/macos
Cloning into '/opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/sebsto/homebrew-macos'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 6, done.

Receiving objects: 100% (6/6), 5.55 KiB | 5.55 MiB/s, done.
Tapped 1 formula (13 files, 21.7KB).
```

Once the tap is added, install the package by typing `brew install xcodeinstall`

```zsh
‚ûú  ~ brew install xcodeinstall

#### Interactive authentication 

```
‚ûú  ~ xcodeinstall authenticate    

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
This tool prompts you for your Apple ID username, password, and two factors authentication code.
These values are not stored anywhere. They are used to get an Apple session ID.

The Session ID is securely stored on your AWS Account, using AWS Secrets Manager.
The AWS Secrets Manager secret name is "xcodeinstall_session"

‚å®Ô∏è  Enter your Apple ID username: <your apple id email>
‚å®Ô∏è  Enter your Apple ID password:

## Minimum IAM Permissions required to use AWS Secrets Manager 

The minimum IAM permisions required to use this tool with AWS Secrets Manager is as below (do not forget to replace 000000000000 with your AWS Account ID)

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "xcodeinstall",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:CreateSecret",
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
                "secretsmanager:PutSecretValue"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:000000000000:secret:xcodeinstall-*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Once associated with an IAM Role, you can attach the role to any IAM principal : user, group or an AWS service, such as an EC2 Mac instance. Here are instructions to do so.

 *Create* an IAM role that contains the minimum set of permissions to allow `xcodeinstall` to interact with AWS Secrets Manager, then *attach* this role to the EC2 Mac instance where you run `xcodeinstall`. 

From a machine where the AWS CLI is installed and where you have AWS credentials allowing you to create roles and permissions (typically your laptop), type the following commands :


1. First create a role that can be attached (trusted) by any EC2 instances:

```zsh
# Create the trust policy file 
cat << EOF > ec2-role-trust-policy.json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"},
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

# Create the role itself (with no permission at the moment)
aws iam create-role \
    --role-name xcodeinstall \
    --assume-role-policy-document file://ec2-role-trust-policy.json
```

2. Second, create a policy that contains the minimum set of permissions to interact with AWS Secrets Manager 

```zsh 
# Create the policy file with the set of permissions
# CHANGE 000000000000 with your AWS Account ID
cat << EOF > ec2-policy.json 
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "xcodeinstall",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:CreateSecret",
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
                "secretsmanager:PutSecretValue"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:000000000000:secret:xcodeinstall-*"
        }
    ]
}
EOF

# Create the policy 
aws iam create-policy                      \
    --policy-name xcodeinstall-permissions \
    --policy-document file://ec2-policy.json
```

3. Third, attach the policy to the role 

```zsh
# Attach a policy to a role 
# CHANGE 000000000000 with your AWS Account ID
aws iam attach-role-policy                                                     \
     --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::000000000000:policy/xcodeinstall-permissions    \
     --role-name xcodeinstall
```

4. Fourth, attach the role to your EC2 Mac instance (through an instance profile)

```zsh
# Create an instance profile 
aws iam create-instance-profile                   \
     --instance-profile-name xcodeinstall-profile

# Attach the role to the profile
aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile             \
    --instance-profile-name xcodeinstall-profile \
    --role-name xcodeinstall   

# Identify the Instance ID of your EC2 Mac Instance.
# You may use the AWS Console or search by tags like this (replace the tag value with yours)
INSTANCE_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-instances                                                 \
               --filter "Name=tag:Name,Values=M1 Monterey"                               \
               --query "Reservations[].Instances[?State.Name == 'running'].InstanceId[]" \
               --output text)

# verify you have an ID (you may add --region to target the correct AWS Region)
echo $INSTANCE_ID

# Associate the profile to the instance 
aws ec2 associate-iam-instance-profile \
    --instance-id $INSTANCE_ID         \
    --iam-instance-profile Name="xcodeinstall-profile"
```

When you start other EC2 Mac instance, you just need to attach the profile to the new instance.  The Policy and Role can be reused for multiple EC2 instances.

## How to store your secrets on AWS Secrets Manager

When using AWS Secrets Manager to retrieve your Apple Developer Portal username and password, you have to prepare an AWS Secrets Manager secret as following:

- secret name : `xcodeinstall-apple-credentials`
- secret format : a JSON string similar to this one :

```json
{"username":"your_username","password":"your_password"}
```

To help you to create this secret, you may use the following command.

Be sure to adjust the name of the AWS Region to your requirements. Using an AWS Region geographically close to you helps to reduce latency)

```zsh
‚ûú  ~ xcodeinstall storesecrets -s us-east-1

This command captures your Apple ID username and password and store them securely in AWS Secrets Manager.
It allows this command to authenticate automatically, as long as no MFA is prompted.

‚å®Ô∏è  Enter your Apple ID username: sebsto@me.com
‚å®Ô∏è  Enter your Apple ID password: 
‚úÖ Credentials are securely stored
```
