The build is failing because the unxip library depends on the Compression framework, which is only available on macOS. The error occurs when trying to build on Ubuntu Linux in the GitHub Actions workflow.

There are a few potential solutions:

1. Make the unxip integration conditional based on the platform:
   - Only include unxip dependency when building on macOS
   - Use fallback to the command-line xip tool on other platforms
   
2. Fork and modify the unxip library:
   - Create a modified version that uses platform-independent compression libraries
   - Update dependency to use the modified fork

3. Build only on macOS:
   - Update the GitHub Actions workflow to use macOS runners
   - This may increase build costs but ensures platform compatibility

The recommended solution is #1 - making the integration conditional. This allows maintaining cross-platform compatibility while still getting the performance benefits of unxip on macOS where possible.

Implementation would involve:

1. Update Package.swift to conditionally include unxip only on macOS
2. Modify InstallXcode.swift to use appropriate method based on platform
3. Update tests to handle both implementations
4. Documentation updates to clarify platform-specific behavior

This maintains the existing functionality while adding the performance improvement where supported.
